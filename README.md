## *Text-Based Adventure Game*
--------------------------------
A Text-Based Adventure Game is a type of game in which a player has to make choices in every step of the game.

Based on these choices, game proceeds and at last, we get to know that whether the player wins or loses the game.

Text adventure games are a retro concept. Back then, graphics were much rarer for computers, much less the extremely niche realm of computer games. But as dull as what is essentially playing a book sounds, some are pretty good, even by current standards.

Text-based adventure games, also known as interactive fiction, are a type of computer game where players navigate through a story using text commands. Instead of relying on graphics or audio, the game describes the environment and characters with written words, and the player types in their actions to progress through the game.
